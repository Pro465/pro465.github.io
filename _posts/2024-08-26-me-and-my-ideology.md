Let's get straight to the point: I'm a far-right (but anti-fascist, I'll elaborate later in this post) 45-yo God-fearing man with the greatest love for this earth.

You may be screaming "but Proloy, you can't be both far-right and anti-fascist!" and then I'd know that you were right, 
IF the years of centrist and leftist propaganda that you were fed were actually true. That is to say, you would be quite wrong, 
wrong to the point you could easily be mistaken as delusional in my eyes. But fear not, my friend, for I am here and willing to show you the light of God.

You see, I am far-right in the sense that I support capitalism and traditional values to what some would call an extreme degree.
But I'm not in the sense that I stand against any form of oppression. 
If you are a leftist, you'd immediately say "But capitalism and most of traditional values are oppressive," to which I'd say, 
"Well, leftist, 1) fuck off, and 2) nope, capitalism is voluntary and our all-good God won't create and share oppressive traditions to His chosen people."

I'm anti-fascist too though, and no, there is no conflict between me being far-right and anti-fascist. 
To see why, let's examine what fascism is:
It's authoritarian, it romanticizes the past, it oppresses the "other," it values traditions.
Only 1 of these I agree with, while 2 I disagree with. So it should be no surprise for you to learn that I am, in fact, an anti-fascist.

Alright, let's move on to my "religion". It cannot be called a religion as it's more of a personal connection with God, but I digress.
My God is Buddha Himself, although note that my "religion" is not Buddhism, its just Him and the teachings He psychically channels into my mind.
For example, He channeled to me a couple lifetimes ago that He needed me to turn Buddhism into a religion of struggle and then lead a group of 
Buddhist militias to conquer the world and turn it into a world led by Buddha.
